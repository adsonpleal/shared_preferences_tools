This package has been discontinued. It has been merged into [flutter/packages/shared_preferences](https://github.com/flutter/packages/pull/6749). Starting from shared_preferences `2.5.0`, this package is no longer needed, as its functionality is now included in the main package. To continue using the tool, please update your shared_preferences version to `>=2.5.0`.

## Description

A [DevTools extension](https://pub.dev/packages/devtools_extensions) for Flutter's [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) package.

It supports all data types available in `SharedPreferences`:

- `String`
- `int`
